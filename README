This is the readme file for the Harrison CMS. It should contain basic information about setting up a simple Harrison project. If you donâ€™t find what you need, please check the [official Harrison project website](http://code.marceleichner.de/project/harrison).

# Installation

* Copy everything, including .htaccess file to an empty folder
	* edit the .htaccess files as described in it
* Run `cleanup.sh` to set all directory permissions
* Local Setup
	* modify `html/ephFrame.php` to find [ephFrame PHP Framework](github.com/Ephigenia/ephFrame)
	* modify `.htaccess` files if needed
* Database Setup
	* create new data base and import `config/structure.sql` to create basic Harrison tables
	* modify `config/db.php` to have access to the db
	
After this you should be able to call http://localhost/[your_installation_path]/admin/ to access the administration area and can login with 'admin@ephigenia.de' and 'adminadmin'.

# Where to Start?

You can start by creating your very own template for Harrison by changing the `$theme` variable of the `AppController` and then create a directory under `views/theme/[themename]`. In there you can do whatever you want.

Use the Node/Pages Tree for creating static content in multiple languages and read them with the NodesController and render them with your Node Views. All files from the `views/node/` directory get listet in the Node-Edit Form.
